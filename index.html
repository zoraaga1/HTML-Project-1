            <h2>🌍 Who am I?</h2>
            <p>Greetings,</p>
            <h5>💻 Passionate About PCs &amp; Programming:</h5>
            <p>
                I’m obsessed with technology—from building PCs to coding my own digital worlds.<br>
                There's something thrilling about making a program come to life (and something equally frustrating when it refuses to work 😅).<br>
                Whether it's developing software, tinkering with hardware, or debugging for hours, I love every second of it.<br>
            </p>
            <h5>🎮 Gaming Enthusiast Extraordinaire:</h5>
            <p>
                When I’m not busy being awesome, you’ll probably find me deep in an intense League of Legends match,                  completely ignoring my responsibilities.<br>Whether I’m carrying my team to victory (or, let’s be real, getting carried),
                my competitive spirit never dies! 🏆🔥
            </p>
            <h5>🐱 Mimi, My Furry Overlord:</h5>
            <p>
                Speaking of responsibilities, I have an adorable but secretly evil cat named Mimi.<br>
                She may look cute, but in reality, she’s the true ruler of my home. I feed her, pet her,
                and give her all my love—yet she still stares at me like I owe her money. 😼💰
            </p>
            <h5>🌅 Sunset Chaser &amp; Sky Gazer:</h5>
            <p>
                When I’m not glued to my screen, I love capturing breathtaking sunsets 🌇, watching the stars twinkle at night ✨,
                and losing myself in the beauty of the sky. There’s something magical about the calm of the night—it's like
                the universe is whispering secrets just for me to hear.
            </p>
            <h5>🌟 What Else?</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>✅ I love animals (except for those terrifying deep-sea creatures… seriously, Google them, they look like aliens).</li>
                <li>✅ I have a strong addiction to tea ☕—Moroccan mint tea is life!</li>
                <li>✅ I enjoy binge-watching TV shows, especially ones with dragons, magic, or dramatic betrayals.</li>
                <li>✅ My dream? To one day adopt an army of cats and have a gaming room that looks like a sci-fi spaceship.</li>
                  </ul>
